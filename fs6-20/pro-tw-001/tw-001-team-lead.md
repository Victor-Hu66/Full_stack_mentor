**1. What is CSS?**

Answer:
* CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.
* Styles define how to display HTML elements
* Styles were added to HTML 4.0 to solve a problem
* External Style Sheets can save a lot of work
* External Style Sheets are stored in CSS files
<br>

**2. What is Selector?**

Answer:The way you declare which elements the styles should apply to. There are different kinds of selectors:

* Class: The most commonly used selector. E.g. “.cloudy” to select an element with classname cloudy. There can be more than 1 element with the same classname.

* ID: Use this sparingly. You cannot reuse an ID within the same page and used only to identify an element uniquely. E.g. ,div id=lovelyweather></div

* Attribute Selector: If you use any attribute other than class or id to identify an element in a stylesheet, you would be using Attribute Selectors. You can also do basic pattern matching within an attribute selector (so if you would like to do basic pattern matching for selectors using class or ID attributes, you would want to use attribute selectors).

* Pseudo-Classes: Classes that are applied to elements based on information that is not present in the markup, e.g. :first-child or :last-child. Do note that the selectors are parsed from right to left (see the demo). You cannot use section article:first-child to select the first occurrence of article, if the first child of section is h1 and not article. Likewise with the :nth-child, and :last-child pseudo-classes.

* Pseudo-Elements: Pseudo-elements differ from Pseudo-Classes in that they actually create an element in the document tree. This is almost the first instance of CSS modifying the HTML document tree. You should ideally use pseudo-elements with “::” instead of “:” (but most browsers accept “:” notation for CSS 2.1 pseudo-elements). Pseudo-elements are: ::first-line, ::first-letter, ::before, ::after (See the demo for how pseudo-elements work).

**3. What is the CSS Box model and what are its elements?**

Answer:The elements are:
* Margin
* Border
* Padding
* Content
<br>

**4. Describe floats and how they work**

*Answer:Float is a CSS positioning property. Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the web page. This is distinctly different than page elements that use absolute positioning. Absolutely positioned page elements are removed from the flow of the webpage.* 

<br>

**5. What is Inline style?**

*Answer – The Inline style in a CSS is used to add up styling to individual HTML elements.*
