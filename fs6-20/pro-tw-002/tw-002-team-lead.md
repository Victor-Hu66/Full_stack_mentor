**1. Briefly describe the correct usage of the following HTML5 semantic elements:**
header, article, section, footer

Answer:
* The header element is used to contain introductory and navigational information about a section of the page. This can include the section heading, the author’s name, time and date of publication, table of contents, or other navigational information.

* The article element is meant to house a self-contained composition that can logically be independently recreated outside of the page without losing it’s meaining. Individual blog posts or news stories are good examples.

* The section element is a flexible container for holding content that shares a common informational theme or purpose.

* The footer element is used to hold information that should appear at the end of a section of content and contain additional information about the section. Author’s name, copyright information, and related links are typical examples of such content.

<br>

**2. Describe the relationship between the header and h1 tags in HTML5.**

*Answer: Only one h1 element was typically present on a page, used for the heading of the entire page. HTML5 specifies that h1 represents the top-level heading of a “section”, whether that be the page body, or an article or section element. In fact, every header element should at least contain an h1 element. If there is no natural heading for the section, it is a good indication it should not use an article or section tag.*

<br>

**3. What is the difference between span and div?**

*Answer: The difference is that span gives the output with display: inline and div gives the output with display: block.Span is used when we need our elements to be shown in a line, one after the other.*

**4. What are the advantages of CSS?**

Answer:

* Bandwidth
* Site-wide consistency
* Page reformatting
* Accessibility
* Content separated from presentation

<br>

**5. Explain universal selector.**

*Answer: The universal selector matches the name of any of the element type instead of selecting elements of a specific type.*
